In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success.
 * @method static Message|boolean|PromiseInterface stopMessageLiveLocation(array $parameters = []) Use this method to stop updating a live location message before live_period expires. On success, if the message is not an inline message, the edited [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 is returned, otherwise True is returned.

The user will not return to the group or channel automatically, but will be able to join via link, etc. The bot must be an administrator for this to work. By default, this method guarantees that after the call the user is not a member of the chat, but will be able to join it. So if the user is a member of the chat they will also be removed from the chat. If you don't want this, use the parameter only_if_banned. Returns True on success.

The bot must be an administrator for this to work and must have the appropriate administrator rights. Returns True on success.

If the chat is not a private chat, the bot must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the 'can_pin_messages' administrator right in a supergroup or 'can_edit_messages' administrator right in a channel. Returns True on success.
