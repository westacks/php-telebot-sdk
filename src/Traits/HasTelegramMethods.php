 *
 * > Alternatively, the user can be redirected to the specified Game URL. For this option to work, you must first create a game for your bot via [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and accept the terms. Otherwise, you may use links like t.me/your_bot?start=XXXX that open your bot with a parameter.

 * Parameters:
 * - _string_ `$callback_query_id` __Required: Yes__. Unique identifier for the query to be answered
 * - _string_ `$text`              __Required: Optional__. Text of the notification. If not specified, nothing will be shown to the user, 0-200 characters

 * - _string_ `$url`               __Required: Optional__. URL that will be opened by the user's client. If you have created a Game and accepted the conditions via @Botfather, specify the URL that opens your game — note that this will only work if the query comes from a callback_game button.Otherwise, you may use links like t.me/your_bot?start=XXXX that open your bot with a parameter.
 * - _int_    `$cache_time`        __Required: Optional__. The maximum amount of time in seconds that the result of the callback query may be cached client-side. Telegram apps will support caching starting in version 3.14. Defaults to 0.

Deep-linking parameter for the /start message sent to the bot when user presses the switch button. 1-64 characters, only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed.Example: An inline bot that sends YouTube videos can ask the user to connect the bot to their YouTube account to adapt search results accordingly. To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an OAuth link.

 *
 * If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL, e.g. https://www.example.com/<token\>. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us.

 * - _int_       `$max_connections`      __Required: Optional__. Maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook for update delivery, 1-100. Defaults to 40. Use lower values to limit the load on your bot's server, and higher values to increase your bot's throughput.

For example, specify [“message”, “edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types.

If not specified, the previous setting will be used.Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.
